                    <aside class="notes">From the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posmodernidad">Wikipedia</a>. Main
                        issue is that it's not only about producing stuff, also a way of looking at the world,
                    and influences politics, trends, fashion,
                        and everything else. Let's look first at the
                        anti-dualism. It says that there's no difference between
                        the programming language, and what's the outside
                        world. Or no difference between code and no-code;
                        program and environment.</aside>

                        languages and programming. Because since there's no
                    difference between a language and the environment, we will
                    use whatever language supports what we need to do right now.

                    <aside class="notes">In the XIII century, Fibonacci
                    introduced the "Arab" notation for two different things:
                        record <em>and</em> perform operations. The so-called
                    Fibonacci sequence was an example used in one of his
                    textbooks to show its power (See? We use directly the result
                    of the operation as part of the next operation!) From the
                    beginning of the century, Unicode is extensively used. Why
                    not use the Arab numbers themselves to present the Fibonacci
                    sequence? Besides, it's written right to left, as in the
                    true Arab script. Raku has so many post-modern features that
                    it would be difficult to enumerate all of them, but the fact
                    that you can deal with (lazy) infinite data structures _and_
                    the infinite number, and that the language itself reflects
                    the script direction of the corresponding alphabet are but a

                      it. Someone wanders "What if", other can implement it.
